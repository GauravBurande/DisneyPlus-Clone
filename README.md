# An amazing clone of Disney Plus' webapp built using ReactJs, NodeJS, Styled Components for styling and Firebase for auth and database.

You can visit the webapp here: [Disney Plus Clone](https://disneyplus-clone-642bb.web.app/)

My preffered weapons of choice to build this webapp:

* NodeJS
* ReactJS
* Styled Components
* Firebase for auth and databse
* Redux for state management

I was curious why so many developers use Firebase, so I decided to build a project using Firebase.

I am a big marvel fan so instead of Netflix, I decided to build a Disney Plus clone.

I did had some issues while building this webapp because the docs I was following were using v8 Firebase and I decided to use v9.

But the final result was amazing, I used styled components for styling.

I also had issue with displaying the profile image, I was getting 403 error every time, I thought it's because the component is rendering even before fetching the image url, but the error was something else I just had to pass referrerPolicy="no-referrer" in the image attributes, which I found while searching solution on stackoverflow.

But it was so soothing to watch the video play after hovering on viewers components.
This project is my most favourite one in all of my portfolio projects.
